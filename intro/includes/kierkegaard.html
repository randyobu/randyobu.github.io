## His Mission


>  Out of love of humankind, out of despair over
> my awkward predicament of having achieved nothing and of being unable
> to make anything easier than it had already been made, out of genuine
> interest in those who make everything easy, I comprehended that it was
> my task: to make difficulties everywhere.

## Central Question
- "What does it mean to exist?"
- Important question for humans
- It's not that we have forgotten the answer, but we have forgotten to ask the question.
- One problem is the ever-growing amount of knowledge.
- The pursuit of knowledge gets in the way of the deeper question of meaning.

## Truth

- Objectivity and subjectivity.
- Truth that is known and truth that is lived.
- Which is most important?

 </textarea> 
 </section>
 
<!-- - Implicit critique of traditional philosophy - truth, when -->
<!-- posessed at all, is possessed in the form of knowledge. -->

<!-- - Kierkegaard is not interested in the philosophical debates -->
<!-- about knowledge, skepticism, etc. -->

<!-- - Emphasizes lack of certainty. -->


<section data-markdown>

- What is important, is not that someone believes or knows, but how they relate themselves to those beliefs.
- What matters is how beliefs are lived.
- "True" is to be true, to live truthfully.

- Background: John 14.6: "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
- If truth can be a way of living, what does this mean for us?
- Truth is fidelity - to another person, oneself, God.

- How can a person that is constantly changing be faithful to anything?
- Emphasizes lack of certainty
- When someone is faced with signifcant choice, no amount of knowledge will resolve the dilemma.
- Choices always concern the future, and the future is hidden.

<!-- - When Abraham decided to obey God, he didn't know that God would -->

<!-- - The truth of fidelity is different in kind from the truth accessible -->
<!-- to knowledge, -->

<!-- - Traditional philosophy and science cannot give us guidance about how -->
<!-- to live faithfully to others, or to ourselves. -->

- When Abraham decided to obey God, he didn't know that God would revoke the command at the last minute.

### Two Views on Abraham

1.  Luther

1.  Lectures on Genesis in 16th century.

2.  Praised Abraham for uncritical obedience to God.

2.  Kant

1.  Abraham should have reasoned that an obviously immoral command
could not have come from God.

Kierkegaard's view in Problem I

- Kierkegaard is writing for 19th century readers who consider
themselves Christians.

- If it is difficult to understand Abraham's response, then faith is
difficult.

- Asks, would you do what Abraham did? Could you?

- Unlikely that anyone thinks they could.

- Tests the readers faith by reflecting on the story.

- The point is not to recommend blind faith in God, but to unsettle
our blind faith in ourselves.

- Challenge the complacent assumption that we are Christians.

- Only when this assumption is abandoned can we engage in the task of
becoming a Christian.

The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical

The Ethical as Universal

- Kant - the ethical holds for all rational people at all times.

- Hegel - the ethical is a shared set of values in a community.

- The ethical is the telos - the reason for which one acts.

- Ethical actions can be mediated, they are intelligible.

- Problem: the object of unconditional commitment could make a demand
on you that is contrary to the ethical.

Sin and Temptation

- Lower immediacy - unreflective acting on desires.

- The ethical - reflective acting on reasons.

- Temptation is a pull back into lower immediacy.

- Sin is acting on desire contrary to the ethical.

What Suspension is Not

1.  Tragic hero.

2.  Thinking the ethical does not apply to me.

3.  Acting on desire rather than the ethical.

Can there be a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

- Yes, if there is an unconditional commitment.

- Teleological because it is done for the sake of something higher.

- If the teleological suspension is not possible, then Abraham is no
hero, just a murderer.

- Nothing special about faith - "Faith has never existed because it
has always existed."

Anguish

- The knight of faith respects the ethical.

- There is a pull back towards the ethical.

- This is anguish.

How to Recognize the Knight of Faith

1.  Respects the ethical

2.  Not a sectarian

3.  Cannot rationalize the action

The Self

*Concluding Unscientific Postscript*

Views

- Greeks - rational soul encumbered with a material body.

- Others - material pleasure-seeker

Pascal

- Man is neither angel nor brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he
who would act the angel acts the brute. (358)

- We do not display greatness by going to one extreme, but in touching
both at once, and filling all the intervening space. (353)

- What a chimera then is man! What a novelty! What a monster, what a
chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy! Judge of all things,
imbecile worm of the earth; depositary of truth, a sink of
uncertainty and error; the pride and refuse of the universe! (434)

- If he exalt himself, I humble him if he humble himself, I exalt him:
and I always contradict him, till he understands that he is an
incomprehensible monster. (420)

Synthesis

- Two parts

- Infinite/finite

- Temporal/eternal

- Freedom/necessity

- Relate to each other

- The self is the stand that one takes on the relation.

- A true self takes the right stand.

- How do we reconcile these conflicting parts?

Possibilities

1.  Don't try

2.  Deny one

3.  Reconcile them by your own effort.

4.  Reconcile them through an unconditional commitment.

### Nine characteristics of a defining relation

1.  Defines who you are as an individual

2.  Gives you a world: determines what is trivial, serious, relevant,
meaningful. Focuses your world. Determines what is important, what
you do.

3.  Cannot be mediated. Cannot be put into concepts.

4.  Your passion produces its object. It is because you have this
infinite passion that they are adorable. Kierkegaard: "Truth is
subjectivity."

5.  The accidental becomes necessary. Accidental in that it happens in
time. Necessary in that is becomes that which defines one.

6.  The Instant restructures your experience of time.

7.  You experience eternity in time. New kind of eternity. For the rest
of your life, everything is interpreted in terms of the defining
commitment. Even the past is interpreted as empty. "Eternal" means
forever.

8.  The relation is irreversible

9.  Completely vulnerable.

This is not something trivial, like a hobby or pastime. It defines who
you are. Vocation.

Avoiding Vulnerability

- Avoid commitment

- Child-like faith

- Love the universal

- Infinite resignation

None of these work. The only way to truly avoid the vulnerability is if
there is a God that can make all things possible.
