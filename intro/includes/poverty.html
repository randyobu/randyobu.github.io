Peter Singer: "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"

	</textarea> 
</section>

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
Singer’s Argument

<ol>
	<li> Lack of food & shelter & medicine is bad.</li>
	<li>. If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it. [Later, he says “without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant,” which weakens the requirement placed on us.]  For example, getting wet in order to save a drowning child.</li>
	<li> It is in our power to prevent this bad thing.</li>
	<li> We can prevent it without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance.</li>
	<li> Conclusion: Therefore, we ought to prevent lack of food & shelter.</li>
	<li> <u>The only way to prevent lack of food & shelter without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance is to give maximally (or at least very much more than we currently do).</u></li>
	<li style="list-style:none;"> Therefore, we ought to give maximally (or at least very much more than we currently do).</li>
