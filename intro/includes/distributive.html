### Important Considerations ###

* Marx's critique of markets
- Markets are biased to the status quo
- Injustice in, then injustice out
* Freedom
- Not about distribution of wealth, about distribution of power.
- Concentration of economic power — increased rich/poor gap.
- Influence of money in politics.

## Three Principles


 </textarea> 
 </section>

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>

### Principle of Greatest Equal Liberty 

>Each person has an equal right to the most extensive liberty compatible with a similar liberty for everyone else.

 </textarea> 
 </section>
 
<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
### Principle of Fair Equality of Opportunity

>Offices and positions should be genuinely open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.

 </textarea> 
 </section>
 
<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
### Difference Principle

>Social inequalities should be arranged so that they are of the greatest benefit to the least advantaged.

 </textarea> 
 </section>
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>

##  Objections

* Hypothetical contract cannot ground moral obligation.
* The contract would not necessarily result in the Difference Principle

 </textarea> 
 </section>
 
<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Justice as Fairness ##

* Justice — arrangement of main institutions
* Distribute main benefits and burdens — rights, jobs, etc.

 </textarea> 
 </section>

<section data-markdown>

### Guiding ideas ###

* Negative thesis — what people don't deserve.
* Positive thesis — how goods should be distributed.

### End-State ###

| Distribution | A    | B    | C    |
| :---:        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D1           | 12   | 10   | 9    |
| D2           | 4    | 22   | 13   |

* Egalitarians want D1
* Rawls wants D3
* Nozick?

* Nozick claims that this requires interfering with liberty.
    * "Liberty upsets patterns."
* Redistribution is almost always unjust.
