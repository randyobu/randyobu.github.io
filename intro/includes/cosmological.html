## Faith and Reason

* No conflict between faith and reason
* Reason can prove *some* truths of Christianity and can be used to defend the faith.
* Reason falls short of faith.
* One can only fully understand God through faith.

## The Five Ways
</textarea>
</section>

<!-- <section data-markdown> -->
<!-- <textarea data-template> -->
<!-- ## The First Way -->

<!-- 1. There is motion in the world. -->
<!-- 1. Nothing can move unless something else causes it to move. -->
<!-- 1. This causal chain cannot be infinite. -->
<!-- 1. There is a first mover, God. -->
<!-- </textarea> -->
<!-- </section> -->


<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>

## The Second Way ##

1. Every observed event in the world has a cause.
1. That cause is itself an effect of another cause.
1. If there were no first cause, then no effect would have occurred.
1. This first cause is God.

### The Third Way ###

1. Every existing thing is contingent, i.e., might not have existed.
1. Every contingent thing requires a cause to exist.
1. Every contingent thing, at some point, did not exist.
1. There was a time, when no contingent beings existed.
1.  A necessary being exists, and caused contingent beings to exist.

<!-- ### The Fourth Way ### -->

<!-- 1. Existing things have properties in varying degrees. -->
<!-- 1. A thing can have a property to a certain degree, only if something else has it to a maximum degree. -->
<!-- 1. That thing is the cause of the property in all other things that have it to a lesser degree. -->
<!-- 1. Things have goodness to some degree. -->
<!-- 1.  This must be caused by the most perfect being, God. -->

<!-- ### The Fifth Way ### -->

<!-- 1. The natural world exhibits apparent design. -->
<!-- 1. The world has no natural intelligence. -->
<!-- 1. Objects cannot achieve their purposes through design unless a designer exists. -->
<!-- 1. The designer is God. -->

### Contemporary Version ###

1. If something exists, its existence is logically necessary (and hence self-explanatory) or some other being causes it to exist.
2. A contingent being's existence isn't necessary.
3. A contingent being is caused to exist by some other being.
4. Either the series of contingent beings has a first member or it doesn't.
5. If the series has a first member, then a necessary being exists and causes it.

6. If the series of contingent beings doesn't have a first member, a necessary being exists and causes the whole series.
7. If contingent beings exist, a necessary being exists which causes them.
8. Contingent beings exist.
9. A necessary being exists and causes contingent beings to exist.

### Objections ###

* Series is explained by its members
* Each member is explained.
* Response: not why any member exists, but why is there a series at all?
* Science can't explain why anything exists.

1. The world has some feature, F.
1. Only the existence of God can explain F.
1. God must exist.

### Objection ###

* Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR): every contingent fact has an explanation.
* Cosmological arguments assume that the PSR is true.
* Can every contingent fact have an explanation?
* The PSR is contingent... what explains why it is true?

#### The Kalam

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
1. The universe began to exist.
1. Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.
1. The cause is God.
