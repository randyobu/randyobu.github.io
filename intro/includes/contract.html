## Social Contract — Objections
</textarea>
</section>



#### Hume's Criticisms ####

* The state is justified in terms of our consent.
* Hume: no one remembers giving consent.
* Social contract theory is irrelevant to the justification of the state.
* Problems with tacit consent
    * Poor people (man on ship)
    * Benefits can't ground obligation. 

## Mill's On Liberty ##


* Mill's goal - allow individuals to flourish as individuals.
* People should have freedom in "that portion of a person’s life and conduct which affects only himself or, if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntarily, and undeceived consent and participation"


### Types of Freedom ###

1. Freedom of thought and expression
2. Freedom of tastes and pursuits
3. Freedom to unite with others

Does liberty conflict with utility?

Is liberty intrinsically valuable?

* Mill writes as if it is.
* Incompatible with utilitarianism
* Mill: liberty is a necessary condition of happiness.

### Harm Principle ###

>The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.

* Applies only to mentally competent adults in developed societies.
* Societies where force can be replaced by free and equal discussion.
* Not justified by rights, but that society is better with the principle.
* Necessary but not sufficient condition for interfering.
* Applies to omissions and actions.
* Not moralism
* Harm: negatively affecting interests.
* Self-regarding actions vs. harm to others
* Self-harm is interfered when
    * Violates rights of others
    * Duties can change - drunk on duty
    * Causes grief to family.
* Freedom to harm self

### Applications ###

* Religion
* Drugs and alcohol
* Trade
* Sex
* Social benefits
    * The government should not intervene to help citizens when
        * Individuals will do it better themselves.
        * When doing it themselves will benefit people's development.
        * Whenever unnecessary - adding to state's power is problematic.

### Freedom of Thought and Expression ###

#### Reasons for Protecting Free Speech ####

1. The opinion could be true.
2. Even if false, it might be partly true.
3. Even if completely false, it keeps true opinions from becoming dogma.
4. A true opinion that becomes dogma loses its meaning.

#### Objections ####

1. The first two reasons assume that free speech is instrumental for producing true belief.
    1. Protecting patently false belief is unlikely to produce true belief.
    2. Even if only false beliefs were censored, would censorship still be wrong?
2. So, we need a reason for protecting free speech even if the speech is obviously false.
    
### Deliberation and Happiness ###

1. Exercising our deliberative capacities is essential to our happiness.
2. We desire knowledge, not merely true belief.
