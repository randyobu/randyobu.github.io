# Thomson


## The Pro-Life Argument:

1. At any stage of pregnancy, the fetus has a right to life.
2. If the fetus has a right to life, and if that right is not in conflict with any more stringent right, then it is morally impermissible to kill the fetus.
3. The fetus’s right to life is not in conflict with any more stringent right.
4. Hence, at any stage of pregnancy, it is morally impermissible to kill the fetus.
5. To abort the fetus would be to kill the fetus.
6. Hence, at any stage of pregnancy, it is morally impermissible to abort the fetus.

## Thomson’s objections

1. Premise 3 isn’t true in cases in which the mother’s life is at stake.
2. If the Pro-Life Argument is a good argument, then the following would be as well. But it isn’t, for its conclusion is false.

### Violinist Argument

1. The violinist has a right to life.
2. If the violinist has a right to life, and if that right is not in conflict with any more stringent right, then it is morally impermissible to kill the violinist.
3. The violinist’s right to life is not in conflict with any more stringent right.
4. Hence, it is morally impermissible to kill the violinist.
5. To unplug yourself would be to kill the violinist.
6. Hence, it is morally impermissible to unplug yourself.

## Thomson’s positive argument

An abortion is morally impermissible only if it either (i) violates the rights of the fetus, or (ii) violates the standards of minimally decent samaritanism.

But an abortion performed in order to avoid large burdens and either (a) to save the woman’s life, (b) where the pregnancy is due to rape, or (c) where the pregnancy is due to contraception failure, neither (i) violate the rights of the fetus nor (ii) violates the standards of minimally decent samaritanism.

Hence, an abortion performed in order to avoid large burdens and either (a) to save the woman’s life, (b) where the pregnancy is due to rape, or (c) where the pregnancy is due to contraception failure, is morally permissible.

## Thomson’s view of rights

How can it be permissible to kill someone if they have a right to life that is not in conflict with any more stringent right? If the right to life were the right not to be killed, this would be impossible. So the right to life is not the right not to be killed. Rather, the right to life is the right not to be killed unjustly. 

So it can be permissible to kill someone even if they have a right to life that is not in conflict with any more stringent right if one does so by denying him the use of something to which he had no right. 

Because the violinist does not have the right to the use of your kidneys, your killing him by denying him the use of your kidneys is not unjust, and hence, does not violate his right to life. So what the pro-life argument needs to establish is not just that abortion is the killing of someone with a right to life, but also that the fetus has the right to the use of the mother’s body.

## Mary Anne Warren

"On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion"

If the fetus is a person, then pregnancy due to voluntary intercourse without contraception is analogous to the following situation: Suppose that violinists are peculiarly prone to the sort of illness the only cure which is the use of someone else’s bloodstream for nine months, and that because of this there has been formed a society of music lovers who agree that whenever a violinist is stricken they will draw lots and the loser will, by some means, be made the one and only person capable of saving him or her. You voluntarily join the society, knowing the possible consequences, and your name is then drawn and you are kidnapped.

In that situation, you are morally required to allow the violinist the use of your body.

Hence, if the fetus is a person, then the woman is morally required to allow the fetus the use of her body.

### Argument that the fetus is not a person

1. If X doesn’t have any of the following characteristics, then X isn’t a person:
1. Consciousness, sentience
2. Reasoning
3. Self-motivated activity
4. The capacity to communicate
5. The presence of self-concepts and self-awareness
2. The fetus doesn’t have any of those characteristics.
3. Hence, the fetus isn’t a person.


# Rosalind Hursthouse

* One can in the exercising of a right act viciously.
* Status of fetus is relevant only to the extent that well-known biological facts are relevant.
* Having a wrong attitude about abortion is to have a wrong attitude about human life in general.

## Traditional Approach

* Is a fetus (or embryo) the type of thing that may or may not be justifiably killed? Is it a member of the moral community?
* Women's rights
* Irrelevant, from the virtue perspective.

### Rights

* The rights of women, while not denied, is irrelevant to the question of the morality of abortion.
* Virtues transcend rights: * “Love and friendship do not survive their parties’ constantly insisting on their rights,...” * Virtue transcends rights in answering the question:
* “In having an abortion in *these circumstances*, would the agent be acting virtuously or viciously or neither?” (emphasis added)

### Fetal Status

* Is the fetus a member of the moral community? 
* “An important metaphysical question.” 	
* Must be answered, but 	
* Is only part of the issue.
* Standard approach (those sympathetic towards Warren) use this line to conveniently dismiss the issue:
* “But they have resulted in what should surely strike any nonphilosopher as a most bizarre aspect of nearly all the current philosophical literature on abortion, namely, that, far from treating abortion as a unique issue ...”
* Moral status is not relevant question under virtue ethics. 
* Relevant question: Family life
* “Pregnancy is unlike any other medical condition.”

### Virtuous Attitude

“To disregard this fact about it, to think of abortion as nothing but the killing of something that does not matter, or as *nothing but* the exercise of some right or rights one has, or as the *incidental means* to some desirable state of affairs, is to do something callous and light-minded, the sort of thing that no virtuous and wise person would do.” (emphasis added)

### Moral significance

* Abortion and miscarriage.

## Euthanasia ##

* Voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary
* Active and passive
* Does it make a moral difference?
* Killing and letting die
* Concerned with intentional actions and omissions.
* Can killing and letting die rest simply on action and omission?
* Turning off the machine vs. not hooking the person up
* Killing is initiating a course of events that leads to death.
* Allowing to die is not intervening
* Agent who kills causes death.
* Agent who lets die allows nature to take its course.
* Sets limits on duties and responsibilities
* Requires no effort to not kill, requires effort to save.
* If killing and letting die were morally equal, then we are just as responsible for the deaths of 
* those we kill as those we fail to save.
* Foot - failing to aid starving Africans would be morally equivalent to sending them poisoned food.
* Ordinary and Extraordinary Means
* Traditional - RC church dealing with surgery prior to anesthesia. Refusing ordinary means is suicide. Refusing extraordinary means is not.
* Proportionate - offers reasonable hope of beneﬁt to patient. Disproportionate if not.
* Relevant - quality and quantity of life.
* Intending death and foreseeing that death will occur
* Pyramid pain-killing
* Vatican - PPK is permissible because death is not intended.
* Doctrine of Double Effect
* Aquinas - applied to self-defense

### Rachels ###

Goal: show that the AMA's Conventional Doctrine on Euthanasia (CDE) is false. Rachels is not taking a stand on the moral permissibility of either active or passive euthansia. His thesis:

If passive euthanasia is morally permissible, then active euthansia is morally permissible.

#### CDE ####

>The intentional termination of the life of one human being by another--mercy killing--is contrary to that for which the medical profession stands and is contrary to the policy of the American Medical Association.

>The cessation of the employment of extraordinary means to prolong the life of the body when there is irrefutable evidence that biological death is imminent is the decision of the patient and/or his immediate family. The advice and judgement of the physician should be freely available to the patient and/or his immediate family.


Rachels' strategy for showing CDE is false:

1. There are cases in which passive euthanasia is morally impermissible and active euthanasia is morally permissible,
2. Passive euthanasia is morally no better than active euthanasia or, equivalently, active euthanasia is morally no worse than passive euthanasia.
3. CDE has implications which are false.

#### First Argument against CDE ####

1. If CDE is true then passive euthanasia never produces more suffering than active euthanasia.	
2. It is not the case that passive euthanasia never produces more suffering than active euthanasia.	
3. Therefore, CDE is not true.

Letting die often creates great suffering, for example, removing food and water.

#### Second Argument against CDE ####

1. If acting in accordance with CDE leads to decisions about passive euthanasia being made on irrelevant grounds, then CDE is false.	
2. Acting in accordance with CDE leads to decisions about passive euthanasia being made on irrelevant grounds.	
3. Therefore, CDE is false.

Downs Syndrome baby that needs simple operation (removing an intestinal obstruction) to save.

Smith drowns a child to get the inheritance.

Jones doesn't save the child to get the inheritance.

#### Third Argument against CDE ####

1. If killing is morally worse than letting die, then for any two cases C1 and C2, where C1 and C2 are exactly alike in all respects except that in C1 there is a killing while in C2 there is a letting die, C1 is morally worse than C2.
2. It is not the case that for any two cases C1 and C2, where C1 and C2 are exactly alike in all respects except that in C1 there is a killing while in C2 there is a letting die, C1 is morally worse than C2.
3. Therefore, It is not the case that killing is morally worse than letting die.	
4. If CDE is true then killing is morally worse than letting die.	
5. Therefore, CDE is not true.
