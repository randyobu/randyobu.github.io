What's the point?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Evidence matters!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</textarea>
</section>


 <!-- Clifford: It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence. -->

<!-- Pascal's wager fails because there is more than one option. In fact, strong rationalism will also fail for the same reason. For any body of evidence, there is always more than one belief that is consistent with that evidence. That does not mean, however, that I can simply believe anything I like. Some beliefs are better than others, even when they are equally supported by evidence. Several criteria for judging beliefs apart from the evidence have been proposed. Simplicity is one. Simple explanations for the evidence are preferred to complex ones. Internal consistency is another. An important criterion is explanatory power. An explanation that explains much of what I believe to be true is preferred to one that explains little. These criteria, however, can fail. Sometimes, simple explanations turn out to be false, or our judgments of consistency turn out to be mistaken.  -->

	 ## James*

	 *frame*
	 *William James and *The Will to Believe**
	 You can believe something for which you have no evidence when the belief is 
	 *description*
	 impossible to decide on the basis of evidence, and
	 [living:] something that you could believe, and
	 [momentous:] something that could have great consequences, and
	 [forced:] something you must either accept or reject
	 *description*
	 *frame*

	 James - the purpose of ideas is to allow us to gain the ends we value. A true idea is one that is useful in doing so. Gravity is true because it does not conflict with our experiences. 

	 Many philosophical debates are pseudo-debates since they make no practical difference in our lives. 

	 Will to believe. We can choose to believe something under certain conditions. Most of the time we cannot, it conflicts with evidence. 

	 Four Conditions: Cannot be settled on evidence, living, momentous, forced. 

	 ## Kierkegaard* % (fold)
	 *sec:kierkegaard*

	 *Fear and Trembling*: ``A young lad falls in love with a princess and the whole content of his life lies in this love.''

	 Nine characteristics of a defining relation:

	 *enumerate*
	 Defines who you are as an individual
	 Gives you a world: determines what is trivial, serious, relevant, meaningful. Focuses your world. Determines what is important, what you do.
	 Cannot be mediated. Cannot be put into concepts.
	 Your passion produces its object. It is because you have this infinite passion that they are adorable. Kierkegaard “Truth is subjectivity.”
	 The accidental becomes necessary. Accidental in that it happens in time. Necessary in that is becomes that which defines one.
	 The Instant restructures your experience of time.
	 You experience eternity in time. New kind of eternity. For the rest of your life, everything is interpreted in terms of the defining commitment. Even the past is interpreted as empty. “Eternal” means forever.
	 The relation is irreversible 9. Completely vulnerable.
	 *enumerate*

	 Aquinas has provided us with an account of how faith could be both voluntary, thus morally praiseworthy, and certain. Faith produces certainty in the believer because it is motivated by one's love of God. It is not that the evidence is compelling in itself, but rather that the love that the believer has for God makes it impossible for her to consider any alternatives. If there is only one possibility, then that possibility becomes a practical necessity.


	 In his work, {\itshape Fear and Trembling*, S\o ren Kierkegaard struggled to understand an event in the life of Abraham. In Genesis 22, God commanded Abraham to take his son, Isaac, to a mountain and offer him as a burnt sacrifice. In the end, Isaac's life is spared, but Abraham is fully prepared to carry out God's demand. How can this be possible? Abraham believes that God has commanded the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham has every reason to believe that this action is irreversible, he will never get Isaac back. The level of confidence that one ought to rationally require for a belief before acting on it is at least in part a function of the cost of the belief being wrong. The cost of the belief being wrong is itself in part a function of the ease of reversing the action. In this case, Abraham's belief, if wrong, has devastating and irreversible consequences if Abraham acts on this belief. So, Abraham, should refuse to act on the belief without absolute certainty that the belief is true. There is no evidence, though, that Abraham can appeal to that will provide such certainty. How then, can he be willing to act on his belief?


	 I think that Kierkegaard gives us a hint to his answer in a telling sentence in {\itshape Fear and Trembling*: ``A young lad falls in love with a princess and the whole content of his life lies in this love.'' Everything that is true about him, his whole identity, lies in his love for the beloved. The love now defines who he is as an individual. He is no longer just Joe, he is Joe, the lover of Mary. His love for Mary determines all of the priorities of his life. It determines what is meaningful and what is trivial. It determines what he will do and what he will not do. It is also not something that can be explained to someone else. When asked, ``What do you see in her?'' there is nothing that can be said to anyone else's satisfaction. If they do not also love Mary, they will never understand. Can Joe be certain that Mary is good? Absolutely, because Mary, for Joe, defines what goodness is. Truth is a function of his love for her.


	 For Abraham, it is impossible that God's command not be good. God, as the ultimate object of Abraham's love, determines what is good for Abraham. So, Kierkegaard's account of faith, although admittedly less systematic, is very much like that of St. Thomas. Faith is the means by which we have true beliefs about God. It is voluntary, one can be attracted to another, but voluntarily refuse to become the lover of that other person. It provides certainty, since everything that is true now is determined by the relation that holds between the believer and God.
