1. Crito would lose his friend
2. Socrates friends will appear in a bad light in the eyes of the many
3. Socrates has an obligation to his children (to raise them)
4. By remaining in prison Socrates would collaborate in his own death — wrong and shameful
5. Socrates was wronged by the city and so he has no obligation to accept his penalty

<!-- Socrates quickly dismisses 1, 3, and 4 as irrelevant (though, at the end of the dialogue, he revisits #4.) -->

## The Central Questions

* Is escaping from prison is an act of wrongdoing?
* Is anyone harmed by Socrates’ escape?

 </textarea> 
 </section>



<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## The Speech of the Laws ##

* If Socrates escapes, he will destroy the city.
* City can't survive if the courts have no force.
* Objection: it was the city who wronged Socrates and it was not right.
* Laws present three arguments.

 </textarea> 
 </section>






<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 

## The Parent Argument ##

1. The state is Socrates’ parent.
2. Everyone ought to obey his or her parents.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will disobey his parent.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.

 </textarea> 
 </section>


<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## The Benefactor Argument ##


1. The state is Socrates’ benefactor.
2. Everyone ought to obey his or her benefactors.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will disobey his benefactor.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.


 </textarea> 
 </section>


<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 

## The Agreement Argument ##

1. Socrates made an agreement to obey the state.
2. Everyone ought to keep his or her agreements.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will violate an agreement.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.

 </textarea> 
 </section>



<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Against the Agreement Argument ##

Three important questions:

1. Is staying a tacit agreement to obey the laws?
2. If so, does it obligate one to do whatever the state commands?
3. Does it obligate one to obey under all conditions?

 </textarea> 
 </section>



<section data-markdown>

## Response

We would like to accept the following two principles:

1. No innocent should be punished
2. All the guilty should be punished (as a condition for our safety).


 </textarea> 
 </section>


<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
* Problem: limited knowledge.
* Can't fulfill both principles.
* Keep one, violate another, or
* Find the best balance.
* Does that mean a moral duty to accept punishment in our own case?
