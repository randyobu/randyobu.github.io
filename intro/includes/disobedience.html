# Crito #






## Story ##

Socrates, the Athenian philosopher (469-399 B.C.) is in prison, waiting for his execution, after being found guilty of

* Studying things in the sky and below the earth,
* corrupting the youth,
* impiety (not believing in the gods of the City and inventing new gods)





His friend, Crito, visits him in the prison (bribing the guard) with the bad news that the execution will take place soon. He offers his help to Socrates to escape from prison. The main text of the dialogue is Socrates’ analysis of Crito’s arguments why he should escape from prison.



Scorates is presumed innocent.




In the first part of the dialogue we meet the characters (Socrates, Crito) and we learn about Socrates’ situation: according to the news brought by Crito and Socrates’ dream, the day of execution is approaching, it will take place within 2 or 3 days.




## Crito's Offer ##

1. Crito would lose his friend
2. Socrates friends will appear in a bad light in the eyes of the many
3. Practical matters can easily be settled
1. Expense is taken care of
2. Safe haven can be found in Thessaly
4. Socrates has an obligation to his children (to raise them)
5. By remaining in prison Socrates would collaborate in his own death (“state assisted suicide”?)
6. Such a voluntary acceptance of his own death is wrong and shameful (in contrast with being right and honorable)
7. Socrates was wronged by the city and so he has no obligation to accept his penalty



Socrates quickly dismisses 1, 3, and 4 as irrelevant (though, at the end of the dialogue, he revisits #4.)


## The Many and the Experts ##

One of Crito’s argument that he and Socrates’ friends in general would appear in a bad light if they did not help Socrates. When Socrates suggests that he should not be concerned with the majority’s opinion, Crito points out that it is very powerful (it can kill as it is manifested by Socrates’ fate itself).




Socrates offers two reasons against Crito’s point:

* The opinion of the many is not powerful as it cannot do the greatest harm (making one foolish) because it cannot do the greatest good (making one wise)
* while this point might reveal Socrates’ value system (giving absolute preference to being wise) we should regard this remark as an instance of “Socratic irony.” This point is a quick shortcut to force Crito to focus on more important issues.
* There are obvious situations when everybody would prefer an expert’s opinion to the many’s (example of physical training)




##  The Central Moral Principle ##

After undermining Crito’s appeal to the opinion of the many, Socrates starts the central argument of the dialogue.




Socrates emphasizes that what follows might not be acceptable to the many – this claim explains in retrospective the importance of arguing against the relevance/importance of the majority’s opinion. We might also add that he owes Crito a proper reason why he does not accept his offer.




The central moral principle Socrates suggests is that one must never do wrong.




The Consequences of the Central Principle:

1. One must never do wrong.
2. Therefore, one must never return a wrong for a wrong.
3. As injuring one is the same as doing wrong to him, one must never injure another.
4. Therefore, even if one is oneself injured, one should not injure the other in return.
5. Furthermore, one should fulfill just agreements with others.





The central questions:

* Is escaping from prison is an act of wrongdoing?
* Is anyone harmed by Socrates’ escape?




## The Speech of the Laws ##

The laws first tell that by escaping from prison Socrates would destroy the laws and the city since the city is destroyed if the verdicts of its courts have no force but nullified by private individuals.




Objection (suggested by Socrates and heartily agreed heartily by Crito): it was the city who wronged Socrates and it was not right.




Answering this objection the Laws offer three further arguments (interestingly, the Laws do not mention that Socrates should not harm the city, according to his own principle, even if he was wronged by the city first).




Stephen Nathanson’s account of the Laws’ arguments:




As Nathanson himself emphasizes this interpretation is not without difficulties, since its portrayal of Socrates as an utterly law-abiding citizen, a “superpatriot,” is not in harmony with the Socrates of other dialogues (e.g. the Apology). This is indeed the starting point of Weiss ‘s unusual interpretation of the Crito.




Nathanson separates three – formally similar but materially – distinctive arguments:




### The Parent Argument ###

1. The state is Socrates’ parent.
2. Everyone ought to obey his or her parents.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will disobey his parent.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.




### The Benefactor Argument ###

1. The state is Socrates’ benefactor.
2. Everyone ought to obey his or her benefactors.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will disobey his benefactor.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.




### The Agreement Argument ###

1. Socrates made an agreement to obey the state.
2. Everyone ought to keep his or her agreements.
3. If Socrates escapes, he will violate an agreement.
4. Therefore, Socrates ought not to escape.




#### Against the Agreement Argument ####




Three important questions:

* Does remaining in a place constitute a tacit agreement to obey its laws?
* If remaining in a place does constitute an agreement to obey the laws, does it obligate one to do whatever the state commands?
* If remaining in a place does constitute an agreement to obey the laws, does it obligate one to obey under all conditions?




It is arguable that our tacit contract contains/implies as one of the citizens’ duties to accept not only warranted punishment, but also unwarranted punishment (i.e. when the citizen is innocent).




As Robert Nozick pointed out we would like to accept the following two principles:

1. No innocent should be punished
2. All the guilty should be punished (as a condition for our safety).




The two principles, however, cannot be reconciled, given the practical limits of human knowledge. Accordingly, it is an impossible standard that no innocent should ever be punished. Instead, we should optimize the ratio of the punished guilty and the punished innocent. If accept Nozick’s claim in general, isn’t it our moral duty to accept it in our own case?






## King ##

* One has a legal and a moral responsibility to obey just laws.
* Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.
* Augustine - "An unjust law is no law at all."
* Aquinas - Unjust law = a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law

* Any law that uplifts human personality is just.
* Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.
* All segregation statutes are unjust because
* Segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.

* An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal.
* A just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.
* A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.
* "...an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law."




### Factions ###

* Federalist 10, Madison
* Can we get rid of them?
* Madison thinks not, great cost to human freedom
* The business of politics is managing factions so they don't destroy common interest.
* If no factions, then no problems for democracy

* Afraid of a majority faction
* Must be a losing side
* No reason to not rebel or be criminals
* No incentive to participate

* Worst thing is to have one or few factions
* If you have factions, then need many
* Crosscutting cleavages
* Majority on one question, but may be a minority on another.
* Incentive to not be a dictator




## Objections ##




### Unjustified in a democracy ###

Objection:  Civil disobedience cannot be justified in a democracy. Unjust laws made by a democratic legislature can be changed by a democratic legislature. The existence of lawful channels of change makes civil disobedience unnecessary.




Replies:

* Constitution can be the problem.
* Takes too long.
* Legal channels are never completely exhausted.
* Legal channels closed in practice.
* Judicial review requires plaintiff to be arrested.
* Nuremberg principles require disobedience
* Justice delayed is justice denied.



### Must exhaust all legal challenges ###

Objection: Even if civil disobedience is sometimes justified in a democracy, activists must first exhaust the legal channels of change and turn to disobedience only as a last resort.




### Tacit consent to obey the law ###

Objection:  We must obey the law under a contract with other members of our society. We have tacitly consented to the laws by residing in the state and enjoying its benefits.




* Deny social contract theory.
* Relinquish benefits.
* Consent must be express.
* No consent to obey unjust laws.





### What if everyone disobeyed? ###

Objection:  What if everybody did it? Civil disobedience fails Kant's universalizability test. Recipe for anarchy.




* Anarchy is not so bad.
* Anarchy is better than despostism.
* Empirically false.
* King's disobedience would not be attractive: negotiation, non-violence, suffering, arrest. Little danger of everyone doing it.
* Disobedience nudges societies towards justice. Just societies are more stable.
