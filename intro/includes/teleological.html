## Paley ##

 * Find watch on the ground
 * Perceive that its parts seem arranged for a purpose
 * Infer that the watch had a designer

### No need ####

 * To have seen the watch made
 * For the watch to run perfectly
 * To know how every part contributes to the purpose
 * To discount it as only one possible configuration
 * To appeal to a principle of order
 * To appeal to a law

### Hume's Criticisms ####

 * Can infer no more cause than required for the effect
 * Disorder in the world
 * Universe and watch are infinitely different
 * Cannot make inference from only one case

### The Teleological Argument ####

 1. Cocks, poems, computers, and so on, exhibit apparent design and are produced by minds.
 2. The world exhibits apparent design.
 3. The world was probably also produced by a mind.

 ### Arguments from Analogy ####

 * Strong when
 * Sample is large
 * No known instances in sample that lack the property in question
 * No relevant dissimilarities between sample the object in question
 * Weaker when these conditions are not met

 ### Evaluating the Argument from Analogy ####

 * Large Sample
 * No known instances of apparent design without actual design
 * Some dissimilarities - are they relevant?

 ### An Inference to the Best Explanation ####

 * State of affairs that requires explanation
 * List possible explanations
 * Rational to believe the most plausible explanation

 ### Evaluating the Argument from Best Explanation ####

Possible explanations for apparent design:

 1. Random chance
 2. Evolution
 3. Designer

 </textarea> 
 </section>

 <section data-markdown> 
	 <textarea data-template> 
 ### Which is Most Plausible? ####

 1. Chance - no explanation
 2. Evolution - too limited in scope
 3. Designer - only explanation

Important: Does not conclusively prove design

 ### The Argument as a Probability Argument ####

 * The probability of a hypothesis (H) is a function of
 * Prior probability: the initial plausibility of H
 * Predictive power: the probability of the evidence if the hypothesis is true

	 </textarea> 
 </section>

 <section data-markdown>

 ### Evaluation of the Probability Argument ####

 * Two hypotheses
 * Naturalism: Every fact is a natural fact and has a natural explanation.
 * Theism: God exists and caused the world to exist.
 * Naturalism may have the higher prior probability.
 * Theism clear has the higher predictive power.
 * Predictive power trumps prior probability.
