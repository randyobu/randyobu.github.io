## Mackie - "Evil and Omnipotence"
* "It can be shown, not that religious beliefs lack rational support, but that they are positively irrational...."

## Key Assumption ##

>A good thing always eliminates evil as far as it can.

## Mackie's "Fallacious" Solutions ##

Good cannot exist without evil.

* Limits omnipotence
* Denies that evil is opposed to good.
* Are good and evil relative or absolute?
* Claim that only enough evil exists to serve as the counterpart of good.

Evil is necessary as a means to good.

* Limits God by causal laws.

The universe is better with some evil than it could be with none.

* Greater Goods Defense
* Charity is good as a means to happiness, so it's pointless to have misery to get charity to get happiness.
* God's goal is not to minimize suffering but to maximize good.
* Cannot justify cruelty, cowardice, etc.

### Evil is due to human freewill ###

* God could have made humans that freely do only good.
* Paradox of omnipotence - Can an omnipotent being make rules that limit himself? Can God create things that he cannot control?

### Theistic Responses ###

	 </textarea> 
 </section>

 <section data-markdown> 
	 <textarea data-template> 
#### Attacking the Argument ####

* Show either that the argument is invalid or that there is no good reason to believe one of the premises.
* Is the argument valid? Yes, given the assumption
* Is premise one true? Yes
* Is premise two true? Yes
* Does evil exist? Certainly
* What about premise three?

 <section data-markdown>

#### Greater Goods Defense ####

* God is morally justified in allowing evils just in case
* those evils bring about some good, *and*
* there is no other way to attain the good that does not require as much evil, *and*
* the good outweighs the evil.

	 </textarea> 
 </section>

 <section data-markdown> 
	 <textarea data-template> 

## Goods ##

* Are there any goods that meet these conditions?
* Courage and charity require evil, but how much?
* The weakness of the Greater Goods Defense is explaining the amount of evil in the world.

	 </textarea> 
 </section>

 <section data-markdown>

## Free Will Defense ##

1. God has created free creatures.
2. True freedom requires the possibility of doing evil.
3. God cannot create creatures that are both free and must always do good.

## Must God Create the Best? ##

* GDD's show that a world with some evil can be better than a world with no evil.
* Objections claim that God should have created a world better than this one.
* Assumes God should create the best possible world.
* Can there be a best possible world?
* If not, then no obligation to create one.

### Redemptive Suffering ###

* 1 Peter 4:12-19
* Can suffering cause one to turn to God?
* If so, would one rationally wish that the suffering had not occurred?
* God is an incommensurate good.

### Where do the Problems Stand? ###

1. Logical problem - fails
2. Evidential problem - harder to respond to, but also harder to show that the premises are true.
3. Existential problem - serious

 <section data-markdown>

### Does the Problem of Evil Succeed? Depends on ###

1. The strength of arguments for the existence of God
2. The strength of the claim that the theist would know God's reasons for permitting evil.
3. The plausibility of some of the possible reasons for permitting evil.

### Evil as Evidence for God ###

#### First Argument ####

Impossible to think that there is too much evil in the world without affirming that God exists.

 <section data-markdown> 
	 <textarea data-template> 
#### Second Argument ####

Impossible to be optimistic about the human condition without affirming that God exists.

## Rebellion ##

* Suffering
* Focus on children, adults "ate the apple."
* Children not yet guilty.
* Problem: either there is no God, or God is a torturer. If there is no God, then anything is permitted, even Fyodor's behavior is then reasonable and acceptable.
* Nice collection, 239
* "I know for certain" 241
* "Beast hidden in *every* man" 241
* Harmony, love of humanity 245
* Duty to return the ticket 245
* What's wrong with the argument?
* From the standpoint of the detached observer.
