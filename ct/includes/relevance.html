## Red Herring - Example
The American Cancer Society has argued that smoking is bad for your health. Many people in the Southeastern United States are dependent upon the tobacco industry for their jobs. Making smoking illegal would have a devastating economic effect on many states. Therefore, the ACS is simply wrong.

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Red Herring
* Original issue: whether smoking has bad health consequences.
* Final issue: The economic impact of making smoking illegal.

## Horse Laugh
* No real response to the argument.
* Ridicule
* Example: Mr. Jones has argued that watching television is emotionally unhealthy. If you believe that, then I’ve got a great deal on some swampland for you.”

## Ad Hominem
* Attacks the person, not the argument
* Diverts attention away from the weakness of the response.

 <textarea data-template> 
## Types
* Personal attack
* Circumstantial
* Pseudorefutation (Tu Quoque)
* Poisoning the Well

 </textarea> 
 </section>



<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Personal attack
* Saying something bad about the person’s character or history.
* Example: "I know that Senator has argued eloquently against increased defense spending. You should know that the Senator is an alcoholic that regularly abuses his dog. Clearly, his argument should be rejected.”
* Using labels: Liberal, fascist, etc.

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Circumstantial ad hominem
* Base the attack on the individual’s situation.
* Almost always a charge of bias or vested interest.

 </textarea> 
 </section>
<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
* Example: "Fred's argument against gun control laws should be dismissed. Of course he would object to such laws. His employer is largest firearms dealer in the state."
* Bias is reason to suspect an argument, but not reason to dismiss it.

 </textarea> 
 </section>


<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Pseudorefutation (Tu Quoque)
* Charge of inconsistency.
* Example: Don't tell me to quit smoking. I know about your pack a day habit.

 </textarea> 
 </section>


<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Poisoning the well
* Committed before the person makes the claim.
* The intent is to get the person to reject something that will be said before it is even said.
* Example: "Don't listen to anything the next speaker will say. She works for a company that is now being investigated for illegal activities."

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Straw Man
* Distorts the other side to make it appear more unreasonable than it is.
* Does not address the actual view.
* Make position seem weak or extreme.
* Example: "Senator Snodgrass has argued that there be a mandatory waiting period before any handgun purchase. Obviously, the senator wants to make all firearm ownership illegal.”

## Subtle Versions
* Taking words out of context.
* Treating the extremes as representative.
* Criticizing early version.
* Criticizing deliberately simplified version.

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Appeal to Ignorance
* Believing that a claim is true simply because it has not been shown to be false.
* In order for this to be a fallacy, the burden of proof must be on the person believing the claim.
* Example: No one has proved that there are no aliens, so they must exist.

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Burden of proof
* One side of an issue usually has the burden of proof.
* It is the responsibility of that side to make its case.
* If case is not made, the other side wins by default.

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
## Conditions
* Less plausible side has the burden of proof.
* Side that makes the affirmative claim has the burden of proof.
* Ceteris Paribus
* One commits a fallacy when one places the burden of proof on the wrong side.
