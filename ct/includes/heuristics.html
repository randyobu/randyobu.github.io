## Human Cognitive Limitations ##

* Attention span, memory, computational ability, time, energy, interest
* Quick Inferences are handy
    * Quick and close enough
    * Sometimes better than slow and precise
    * Is that a predator? Which fork in the highway should I take?

## Inferential Heuristic ##

* General strategy, cognitive shortcut
* Quick, used frequently
* Usually not aware

### Heuristics & Biases ###

* Like many cognitive mechanisms inferential heuristics often very useful.
* Fast: allow us to draw rapid inferences without having to gather data or compute probabilities
* Automaticity: almost automatic
* But heuristics can lead us astray in systematic ways
* These systematic patterns of error are called biases

* Do more people in U.S. die from
	* Murder? 
	* Suicide? 
	* In a fire?
	* Drown?
	* Are there more English words that begin with 'r' or that have 'r' as their third letter?
	* Are there more famous people from Oklahoma or from Kansas (a state with roughly the same population)?

## Availability Heuristic ##

* Drawing conclusions about frequencies or proportions based on cases easily available in memory or imagination
* We often conduct sampling "in our heads“
* This Heuristic is often accurate
* More Fords or Jeeps?
* We think there are more Fords because we remember seeing more Fords
* When things are available because frequent, the heuristic works

* But other reasons for availability:
    * Media effects
        * Risk (terrorist vs. stroke)
        		* Fewer than one in a million U.S. citizens killed byterrorists	l
                * Homicide vs. stomach cancer
                	* Killed by sharks or pigs
    	* Winning the Lottery (makes the papers, but rare)
    	* Miracle cures, the rare recovery gets the publicity

    * Ease of recall
    	* Many things readily available in memory, imagination
    		* More 6 letter words ending in
    			* ‘ing’ 
    			* With `n’ as their fifth letter
    			* About the same
    			* Need more info to tell
            * Prejudices & Stereotypes ##
                * Often tend to remember behavior that fits a stereotype

## Representativeness Heuristic ##

* Representativeness heuristic: concluding that the more x seems like a representative or typical A, the more likely x is to be an A.

 </textarea> 
 </section>

<section data-markdown> 
 <textarea data-template> 
* We reason like this:
	* x seems a lot like your typical A
	* Therefore x probably is an A
	* Mike seems a lot like your typical pro football player Therefore Mike probably is a pro football player

<!-- * Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations. Which is more likely: -->
<!-- 		* Linda’s a bank teller -->
<!-- 		* Linda’s a bank teller and active in feminist movement -->
<!-- 	* Linda strongly resembles (what we think of as) a typical or representative feminist -->
<!-- 	* So we conclude that she probably is a feminist -->
<!-- 	* Over reliance on the representativeness heuristic may be one reason people commit the gambler's fallacy. -->
<!-- 		* HTHHTHTT -->
<!-- 		* HHHHTTTT -->
<!-- 		* The first seems more like our conception of a typical random outcome. -->
<!-- * The more detailed/specific a description of something, the less likely it is to occur. -->
<!--     * But it may seem to fit a profile better. -->

## Base Rate Information ##

* Base rate for a characteristic: the frequency or proportion of things in the general population that have that characteristic
    * Many more Fords than Jeeps
    * More bankers than pro football players
* Base Rate Fallacy: neglecting base-rates in forming judgments about probabilities

## Safeguards ##

* Don't be misled by highly detailed descriptions/profiles
* Their specificity makes them easier to imagine, but it also make them less likely to be true
* Use base-rate information whenever possible
* You often don’t need precise knowledge of base rates
* Just knowing that they are a lot more of one sort of thing (e.g., bankers) than another (e.g., pro football players) often enough.

## Anchoring & Adjustment ##

* Estimate the percentage of African countries in the UN  (how much is it above, or below, 10%)?
    * Average response about 25%, (correct answer: 35%)
* Estimate percentage of African countries in UN (how much is it above, or below, 65%)?
    * Average response about 45%.
* In first group most think 10% too low, But they still begin with it and adjust up (to 25%)
* In second group most feel 65% too high, But they still begin with it and adjust down (to 45%)
* The original starting point--10% or 65%--provides a reference point or anchor
* Anchoring and Adjustment Bias: occurs when we don't adjust enough from an original "anchor"
* We begin with an anchor as a reference point, Then adjust up or down, But often don’t adjust enough, So the anchor skews or biases our judgment
* Within 5 seconds estimate the product of:
    * 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
        * In experiments median response about 2250.
    * If instead ask people to quickly estimate product of:
    * 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8
        * median response about 512.
    * It appears people perform just a few of the multiplications, anchor on the result, and adjust upward from there
        * (The correct answer is 40,320)
* Anchoring effects occur even when anchoring values are believed to be arbitrary
    * In UN study anchor values set by having subject spin a wheel like the one on Wheel of Fortune (rigged to stop at either 10% or 65%).
    * So they believed the anchors arbitrary
    * But the anchors still had a strong effect

## Anchoring Effects with Extreme Values ##

* Anchoring effects also occur when anchoring values are ridiculously extreme
    * Subjects asked to estimate the number of Beatles records that made the Top Ten after first being asked if number less than 100,025
    * This ridiculously high number served as an anchor and led to higher estimates
* Even when people are offered money for doing well they remain susceptible to anchoring biases
* Anchoring and Adjustment in the Real World
    * We can fall prey to an anchoring bias any time examples or numbers are used to provide a frame of reference
    * Often current situation--the status quo--provides an anchor
    * First impressions also provide anchors
    * This may help explain the primacy effect
* Anchoring may also help explain hind-sight bias
    * In hindsight we are anchored to what we know about how things actually turned out



## Anchoring & Manipulation ##

* Where people susceptible to a bias, others will exploit it
    * Experienced negotiators often begin with extreme demands in hopes of setting extreme anchors
    * Everyone knows adjustments will be made in the direction of less extreme demands
    * But the more extreme the anchor, the greater its capacity to lead to an outcome closer to the one the negotiator wants.
* Also used by auctioneers, Advertisers, Spouses, Kids
* Safeguards
    * We often don’t realize an anchor is influencing us
    * So first step: get in habit of thinking about predictions and negotiations in terms of anchoring and adjustment
    * Then watch out for anchors that seem extreme
    * Can also considering several different anchor values
    * And if someone proposes an extreme anchor, counter with an anchor at the opposite extreme
